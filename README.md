# Type Error in TypeScript add function
This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript that occurs when a function is called with arguments of an incorrect type. The `add` function is defined to take two numbers as input, but it is called with a string and a number, resulting in a type error. The solution shows how to fix the error by adding type guards or using type assertions.
